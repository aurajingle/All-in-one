Write a complete and syntactically correct Python program to solve the following problem: You are the payroll manager for SoftwarePirates Inc. You have been charged with writing a package that calculates the monthly paycheck for the salespeople. Salespeople at SoftwarePirates get paid a base salary of $2000 per month. Beyond the base salary, each salesperson earns commission on the following scale:
Sales  <$10000 Commission Rate 0 Bonus 0
Sales  $10000 – $100,000 Commission Rate 2% Bonus 0
Sales  $100,001 - $500,000 Commission Rate 15% Bonus $1000
Sales  $500,001 - $1,000,000 Commission Rate 28% Bonus $5000
Sales  >$1,000,000 Commission Rate 35% Bonus $100,000

1. The following additional conditions apply:
2. If a salesperson has taken more than 3 vacation days in a month, their pay gets reduced
by $200
3. A salesperson earns a bonus only if they have been with the company for 3 months or
more
4. For salespeople who have been with the company for 5 years or more and who have
made sales greater than $100,000 an additional bonus of $1000 is added.
All input to the program will be interactive from the keyboard. The output of the program will include:
a. The name of the salesperson
b. Their longevity with the company
c. Their base salary
d. The commission earned (in Dollars)
e. The bonus earned
f. Additional bonus earned (if any)
g. Deductions (if any)

#student-Grades-Calcuation-2
Write a complete and syntactically correct Python program to solve the following problem:
You are the professor for COSC 1336 at Austin Community College. You want to write a program that will take in the numeric grades of the students in your class. Since the students in a class vary from semester to semester, there is no fixed number assigned to the number of students. You will keep track of how many students’ grades you input. You will stop taking input when the student enters a grade of -1.
Your program will use loops and will accomplish the following:
1. Read in a numeric grade from a student.
2. Convert the numeric grade to a letter grade using the grade policies in your syllabus.
3. Keep a running total of the numeric grades entered.
4. Keep a count of the number of grades entered.
5. Issue a message that comments on the letter grade earned. As an example, you may
write “You made an F! Obviously you did not study!”
6. At the end the program will calculate a class average unless there were no grades
entered.
All input to the program will be interactive from the keyboard. The output of the program will include the individual grades converted, the message issued to the student, a class average, and the number of grades entered.
